# thealtres-sources

Annotations created in the Thealtres project, which compares theater in Alsatian with popular theater in German and French. See https://thealtres.pages.unistra.fr for a project description.

## Project structure

So far the data are produced with online spreadsheets. They will later be converted to TEI feature structures, using the method devised in earlier work [(Ruiz & Berm√∫dez, 2022)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7110069).

For each tradition (Alsatian, German, French), we have two workbooks:

- **Titles**: Play metadata and data collection information (where found etc.)
- **Annotations**: Character social variables, setting, number of acts/scenes, etc.

## Alsatian

For Alsatian, the data are organized slightly differently, given that a lot of data come from our earlier project, [MeThAL](https://methal.pages.unistra.fr)
